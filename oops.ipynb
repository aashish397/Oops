        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP enables code reusability, modularity, and scalability by encapsulating data and behaviors into objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-> Class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in OOP. It defines the attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-> An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-> Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only essential features,Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding.\tAchieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public) and getter/setter methods. whereas,  \n",
        "Encapsulation: \tRestricts direct access to certain data and ensures controlled modification. Focus\tHides implementation details to make usage easier.\tRestricts data access and ensures data integrity.\n",
        "Example\tA car’s steering wheel hides the complexity of turning the wheels.\tThe engine is hidden inside the hood, preventing direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in python?\n",
        "-> Dunder (short for Double Underscore) methods, also called magic methods, are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). These methods are used to override built-in behaviors and enable customization of class functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain thr concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-> Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP.\n",
        "-> Polymorphism (Greek: poly = many, morph = forms) is an OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single interface to handle multiple data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in python?\n",
        "-> Python achieves encapsulation using access modifiers:\n",
        "   1. Public (self.variable) – Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "   2. Protected (self._variable) – Should not be accessed directly but is still accessible.\n",
        "   3. Private (self.__variable) – Cannot be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in python?\n",
        "-> A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize objects when they are created. In Python, the constructor method is __init__(), which is called automatically when an object is instantiated from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "->  1. Class Method (@classmethod): A class method is bound to the class rather than an instance. It takes cls as the first parameter and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "   2. Static Method (@staticmethod): A static method does not depend on instance or class attributes. It does not take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in python?\n",
        "->  Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. It provides flexibility by enabling different behaviors based on the provided arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "->  Method overriding is an OOP feature that allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in python?\n",
        "->  The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods for class attributes, allowing controlled access to private variables while maintaining a simple attribute-like syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "->  Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects. It enhances code flexibility, reusability, and scalability.\n",
        "Increases Code Reusability:\n",
        "<> Same function name, different behaviors → Avoids code duplication.\n",
        "<> Allows writing generalized code that works for multiple object types.\n",
        "Supports Method Overriding for Dynamic Behavior:\n",
        "<> Allows child classes to override a parent class method to implement specialized behavior.\n",
        "<> Achieves runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding).\n",
        "Enables Operator Overloading:\n",
        "<> Allows customizing built-in operators (+, -, *, etc.) to work with user-defined objects.\n",
        "<> Achieves compile-time polymorphism.\n",
        " Improves Maintainability and Scalability:\n",
        "<> Makes the code easy to extend without modifying existing functionality.\n",
        "<> Ideal for large applications where different objects need to share the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in python?\n",
        "->  An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by its subclasses, enforcing a structure.\n",
        "Python provides abstract classes using the abc (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "->  Code Reusability (DRY Principle):\n",
        "<> OOP promotes reusability through inheritance – a child class can reuse code from a parent class.\n",
        "<> Avoids code duplication, reducing development time.\n",
        " Encapsulation (Data Hiding & Security):\n",
        "<> Encapsulation restricts direct access to object data, ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "<> Private variables (__variable) and getter/setter methods help protect sensitive information.\n",
        " Improved Code Maintainability:\n",
        "<> Modular code makes debugging and updating easier.\n",
        "<> Changes in one part of the code do not affect unrelated parts.\n",
        " Polymorphism (Flexibility & Extensibility):\n",
        "<> Same method, different behavior – Allows objects to be treated generically.\n",
        "<> Supports method overriding and operator overloading for flexibility.\n",
        " Scalability & Extensibility:\n",
        "<> OOP allows new features to be added without modifying existing code.\n",
        "<> Helps manage large-scale applications efficiently.\n",
        " Real-World Modeling (Better Problem-Solving):\n",
        "<> OOP represents real-world entities (e.g., Car, Person, BankAccount).\n",
        "<> Objects store data (attributes) and behavior (methods), making code more relatable.\n",
        " Improved Collaboration & Readability:\n",
        "<> OOP promotes modular development, making it easier for teams to collaborate.\n",
        "<> Code is structured into classes, improving readability and understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-> Class Variable: A class variable is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside any method.\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "<> Defined at the class level and shared among all instances.\n",
        "<> Changing it affects all instances of the class.\n",
        "<> Accessed using ClassName.variable or self.variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable: An instance variable is unique to each object (instance) of a class. It is defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "<> Defined inside methods using self.\n",
        "<> Each instance gets its own copy of the variable.\n",
        "<> Changing an instance variable affects only that instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "->  Multiple Inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to access the attributes and methods of multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "->  In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special (dunder) methods used to define how objects of a class should be represented as strings. These methods help control how an object is displayed when printed or inspected.\n",
        " __str__: User-Friendly Representation:\n",
        "<> The __str__ method is used to return a human-readable (informal) string representation of an object.\n",
        "<> It is called by the print() function or str(object).\n",
        "<> Its purpose is to provide a well-formatted, user-friendly output.\n",
        " __repr__: Developer-Friendly Representation:\n",
        "<> The __repr__ method is used to return a formal, unambiguous string representation of an object.\n",
        "<> It is called by the repr(object) function or when inspecting objects in a Python shell.\n",
        "<> Its purpose is to provide a string that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "->  The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class inside a child class. It is especially useful in inheritance, allowing child classes to access and extend the functionality of parent classes without directly referencing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "->  The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class inside a child class. It is especially useful in inheritance, allowing child classes to access and extend the functionality of parent classes without directly referencing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "->  @staticmethod:\n",
        "A static method is a method inside a class that does not require access to the instance (self) or the class (cls). It behaves just like a regular function but is logically grouped inside a class.\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "<> Does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as the first parameter.\n",
        "<> Can be called on the class itself or an instance.\n",
        "<> Used when a method is related to the class but does not need to modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        " @classmethod:\n",
        "A class method is a method that operates on the class itself rather than instances. It takes cls as the first parameter, allowing it to modify class attributes.\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "<> Takes cls as the first parameter (reference to the class).\n",
        "<> Can modify class-level attributes (shared by all instances).\n",
        "<> Can be called on the class itself or an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "->  Polymorphism means \"many forms\"—the ability of different objects to respond to the same method name in different ways. In Python, polymorphism is commonly achieved through method overriding in inheritance.\n",
        "Key Benefit: It allows different classes to share the same method name, making code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        " Polymorphism Using Method Overriding in Inheritance:\n",
        "When a child class provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class, it is called method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "->  Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line. This is done by having each method return self (the instance itself), allowing the next method to be called immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "->  The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define __call__ inside a class, you can invoke an object of that class using parentheses (), just like a function.\n",
        "Key Benefit: It makes objects callable, meaning they can be used as functions while still maintaining state.\n",
